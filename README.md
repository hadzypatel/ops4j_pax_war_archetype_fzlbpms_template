ops4j_pax_war_archetype_fzlbpms_template
========================================

This project is part a academic term paper.
Its main purpose is be a base model to another funcional projects.
To achieve this, the "mvn archetye:from-project" will be issued to create a archetype.

This can be interesting for others because its configuration.
This is configured to be a war (serlvet 2.5) package that can be deployed in a web container and in a osgi container too.
This is based on war archetype cited in http://blog.nanthrax.net/tag/pax-web/.

Beside this, it was based on https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate/
The (maybe) interesting point here is that, beside build benefits:
the build will ocurr automatically at the build project
if the dojo sdk was not present, it will be downloaded automatically base on <dojo.version> pom propertie.

I am learning all this technology, so any help is well accepted.
